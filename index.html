Your project should have one HTML file that has:

<!-- + a form for user information submission -->
  <!-- + the ability to select whether the donation will be a single amount or per lap -->

<!-- + a table to display each donor's submission information -->
  <!-- + a button labeled Donate to process the submission -->
  <!-- + a button labeled Cancel to clear the submission form -->

<!-- The donor information should be stored as JS objects that contain their content type as keys and the submitted information as the value. `{name: "John Donut", pledge: 70}` -->

<!-- This should use col-md-6 -->

  <!-- For display on the page, use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) to style the form and table elements. Use Bootstrap's grid system and styling classes to get the following effects. -->

  <!-- + at desktop size display the table on the left and form on the right with some space around the sides -->
  <!-- + the page should have the same display on a tablet in landscape mode, but with no space at the sides -->
  <!-- + on mobile/vertical tablet the table should display above the form -->
  <!-- + the table entries should be alternately striped -->

  <!-- On top of these styling requirements, feel free to apply any of your own personal styling via your own CSS or Bootstraps myriad styling effects to enhance the display style and usability of your page. -->
